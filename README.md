A minimalist terminal user interface (TUI) for following football (soccer) matches in real-time. Get live match updates, finished match statistics, and minute-by-minute events directly in your terminal.

Golazo was created for those moments when you can't stream or watch matches live. It gives you a handy, non-intrusive, and minimalist way to keep up with your favourite football leagues.

*Perfect for developers and terminal enthusiasts who want match updates without leaving their workflow.*
